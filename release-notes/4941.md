Drop support to build Forgejo with the optional go-git Git backend. It only affects users who built Forgejo manually using `TAGS=gogits`, which no longer has any effect. Moving forward, we only support the default backend using the git binary. Please get in touch if you used the go-git backend and require any assistance moving away from it.
