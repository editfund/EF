fix: In a Forgejo Actions workflow, the `unlabeled` event type for pull requests was incorrectly mapped to the labeled event type.
fix: When a Forgejo Actions issue or pull request workflow is triggered by an `labeled` or `unlabeled` event type, it misses information about the label added or removed. It is now available in the `label` data member of the event payload.
fix: The pull request workflow must always update the head SHA commit status. Not just when the PR is synchronized, opened or closed. Otherwise it makes it impossible to define a job to be a required check (for instance a job that is triggered when labels are modified and verifies that a given combination is present).
