Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web endpoints that are only meant to be used internally, for instance when the SSH daemon is used to push a commit with Git. The verification of this token was not done in constant time and was susceptible to [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack). A pre-condition for such an attack is the precise measurements of the time for each operation. Since it requires observing the timing of network operations, the issue is mitigated when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet because the ISP introduce unpredictable random delays.
