Reimplemented editor Tab key handling with accessibility safeguards.

The primary goal is to balance having the editor work as expected by developers (with Tab key affecting indentation) while also not impeding keyboard navigation.

* Tab indents, Shift+Tab unindents, but only when that indent would be valid. E.g. moving existing list items down or up one level.
* Indenting a selection always works. Pressing Tab while inside of text without selection never works.
* When an "invalid" indent is attempted, nothing happens and a toast is shown with a hint to press again to leave the editor.
* Attempting the same action again allows the textarea lose focus as it would already.
* Pressing Esc also loses focus immediately.
* No tab handling happens until the text editor has been interacted with (other than just having been focused).
* Changing indentation in block quotes adds or removes quote levels instead.
