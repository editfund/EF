When migrating from a Forgejo version lower than v10, the TOTP secrets found to be corrupted are now transparently removed from the database instead of failing the migration. TOTP is no longer required to login with the associated users. They should be informed because they will need to visit their security settings and configure TOTP again. No other action is required.
