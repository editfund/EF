Remove support for Couchbase as a session provider; it instead will now fallback to the file provider. The rationale for removing Couchbase support is that it's not free software, https://www.couchbase.com/blog/couchbase-adopts-bsl-license/, and therefore cannot be tested in Forgejo and neither should be supported.
